# sql-challenge

The assingment for this challenge was to model and then engineer a database for employee data, then to perfrom some analysis.

My submission includes the starter data, a .png file of my ERD, schema.sql which contains my schema, and queries.sql which contains the queries. 

All work is original and based off of class instruction and documents, or my previous sql knowledge.
